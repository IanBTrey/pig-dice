## Description
Basically this project is somewhat of a game that pitts two players against each other.Players take turns rolling a six-side dice with the option of holding just as a precaution.Every roll of a dice outputs a random number that acts as a roundscore except when rolling a 1,you get a zero score and the turn goes to your opponent.The first player to hit or surpass the hundred score wins.
